Description:
------------

    Professor Owl is a C++ Code generator for the Object Window Library.
    It is the fastest way to wrte OS/2 applcations using your Borland C++
    compiler and the Object Window Library classes. Professor Owl generates
    skeleton applications, make files, and C++ code with headers.
    It is easy to add objects and classes with functions/events to your
    existing C++ files or new C++ files.

    You push the buttons and let Professor Owl do the rest.
    It knows about hundreds of functions, parameters and classes
    that make up the Object Window Library(tm).

    Now released as Open Source under the GNU GPL License.


Dear Programmer,
---------------

Quick start for instalation. Unzip all files into a temporary directory,
from this temp directory run INSTALL.CMD - this will copy the files to
a final directory and create the desktop objects and shadows.

Thank you for evaluating Professor Owl order. I hope it brings you many
productive hours of joy. 
 

Startup

When Professor is first run, it will look for C++ code in
the current directory. If none is found. It will ask to
create an application. Run the setup to set your paths
correctly got BC++ and your owl directory. Select Path
from the File menu and make a sample directory. In this
directory you can create an application.


Sincerely,


Ed March
